/BEGINNING/
Hello! Welcome reader! Hopefully you have coded before, because this
is going to be a challenging adventure. 
This document was written with the purpose of guiding the reader through the ins and outs of the code,
and every nuance that we know of.

/IMPORTANT INFORMATION/
The very first thing we recommend you do is go to docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html
This the FRC and WPILIB reference website. 
This website contains a bunch of useful guides, tips and tricks, and example code that will be 
very helpful for troubleshooting and implementing code you write into the overall structure of the code.
Use it if this guide doesn't contain the specific answer you need.
